# selected-git-exercises
Selected exercises and diagrams for the carpentries git course.

These are intended to be shown to workshop participants just by showing them the main.md file. This means formatting within the solution dropdown is preserved (unlike using Pages). I tend to zoom in so that students can only view one exercise at a time (to prevent students skipping ahead).
